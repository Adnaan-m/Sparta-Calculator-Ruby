2. Search for the Sparta-Calculator-Ruby repository.
3. Download the files displayed.

### Challenges
The implication of a specific function to ask the user whether they would like to restart the calculator or quit. The code creation was simple but had to be repeated twice withi the code (once for the standard calculatior and once for the advanced calculator). A function would have reduced the lines of code making it more re-usable and neat.

### Learning points
1. Programming languages are very similar in the sense of coding but differ syntactically.
2. Ruby is a very simplified programming language in comparison to Javascript making it more user-friendy.
